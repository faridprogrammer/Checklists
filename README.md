To see the list of checklists (:D) go to the following address.

This repository contains some checklists for those who think the checklists are useful and using them. 
The checklists available here can be gathered from elsewhere which in these cases the source of checklists is provided to the user.

# Why?

Certainly there are excelent websites and apps to find checklists. But I needed a simple alternative which can be easily managed.
